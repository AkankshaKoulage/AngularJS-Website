                        <p><b>Volleyball</b> is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each team tries to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's
                             court under organized rules. It has been a part of the official program of the Summer Olympic Games since 1964.
                             Now volleyball has changed to rally scoring. Essentially, teams score points whenever the other team messes up, and a point is awarded on every serve. Depending 
                             on the level of competition, most matches are now played as the best three out of five games to 25 points.Volleyball is played by two teams of six players on a court 
                             divided by a net. The object of the game is to send the ball over the net so that the opposing team cannot return the ball or prevent it from hitting the ground in their court. Each team has three hits to attempt to return the ball.</p>
                       <p><b>Fitness</b> is defined as the quality or state of being fit. Around 1950, perhaps consistent with the Industrial Revolution and the treatise of World War II, the term "fitness" increased in western vernacular by a factor of ten. Modern definition of fitness describe           either a person or machine's ability to perform a specific function or a holistic definition of human adaptability to cope with various situations. This has led to an interrelation of human fitness and attractiveness which has mobilized global fitness and fitness              equipment industries. Regarding specific function, fitness is attributed to person who possess significant aerobic or anaerobic ability, i.e. strength or endurance. A holistic definition of fitness is described by Greg Glassman in the CrossFit journal as an increased          work capacity across broad times and modal domains; mastery of several attributes of fitness including strength, endurance, power, speed, balance and coordination and being able to improve the amount of work done in a given time with any of these domains. A well rounded       fitness program will improve a person in all aspects of fitness, rather than one, such as only cardio/respiratory endurance or only weight training. </p>

                        <p> <b>Yoga</b> is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines which originated in ancient India. There is a broad variety of Yoga schools, practices, and goals in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Among the most well-known types of yoga are Hatha yoga     and Rāja yoga.The origins of yoga have been speculated to date back to pre-Vedic Indian traditions, it is mentioned in the Rigveda,[note 1] but most likely developed around the sixth and fifth centuries BCE, in ancient India's ascetic and śramaṇa movements. The               chronology of earliest texts describing yoga-practices is unclear, varyingly credited to Hindu Upanishads and Buddhist Pāli Canon, probably of third century BCE or later. The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali date from the first half of the 1st millennium CE, but only gained          prominence in the West in the 20th century. Hatha yoga texts emerged around the 11th century with origins in tantra.</p>
